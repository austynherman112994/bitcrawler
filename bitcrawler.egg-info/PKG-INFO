        ## Example Crawler
        The below example extends the crawler object and overrides the parse function.
        The parse function is always called at the end of crawling. It is passed all the pages fetched.
        In the below example the pages are parsed using beautifulsoup and the title is printed with the URL.
        ```py
        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
        from bitcrawler.crawler import Crawler
        
        class MyCrawler(Crawler):
            def parse(self, webpages):
                for page in webpages:
                    # If page response is not none, response code is in 200s, and document is html.
                    if page.response and \
                       page.response.ok and \
                       page.response.headers.get('content-type').startswith('text/html'):
                    soup = parsing.HtmlParser(page.response.text, "html.parser")
                    print(page.url, "- ", soup.title) 
        
        
        # Initializes the crawler with the configuration specified by parameters.
        crawler = MyCrawler(cross_site=True, crawl_depth=2, multithreading=True)
        # Crawls pages starting from "http://test.com"
        crawled_pages = crawler.crawl("http://test.com")
        ```
